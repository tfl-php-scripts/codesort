# CodeSort2 Enhanced 

Original author is [Jenny](http://prism-perfect.net) / Original readme is [here](codesort2/readme.txt).

#### I would highly recommend not to use this script for new installations. Although some modifications were made, this script is still pretty old, not very secure, and does not have any tests, that's why please only update it if you have already installed it before.

This version requires at least PHP 5.6.

## Upgrading

If you are using an old version of CodeSort 2.0 or CodeSort 2.1:

1. **Back up all your current CodeSort2 configurations, files, and databases first.**
2. Take note of your database information in all your `codesort2/codes-config.php` files.
3. Download [an archive of the codesort2 folder in this repository](https://gitlab.com/tfl-php-scripts/codesort/-/archive/master/codesort-master.zip?path=codesort2). Extract the archive.
4. Replace your current `codesort2/` files with the `codesort2/` files from this repository. 

That's it! Should you encounter any problems, please create an issue here, and I will try and solve it as soon as possible.
